first_subject = "marks of the first subject"
second_subject = "marks of the second subject"

total_marks = first_subject + second_subject + third_subject + fourth_subject + fifth_subject + sixth_subject

calculate_the_percentage = total_marks / total mark of all the six subject * 100

print(calculate_the_percentage)




for example;


first_subject = 90
second_subject = 80
third_subject = 95
fourth_subject = 85
fifth_subject = 87
sixth_subject = 91

total_marks = first_subject + second_subject + third_subject + fourth_subject + fifth_subject + sixth_subject

calculate_the_percentage = total_marks / 600 * 100

print(calculate_the_percentage)
